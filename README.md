The mission is to find the treasure. The steps are:

  Let's say I want to go left.
* You come to a Lake, there's an Island in the middle of the Lake. Type wait to wait for a boat, type swim to swim across. 

  I'm going to wait for a boat. 
  
* You arrive at the Island unharmed, there's a house with three doors, one red, one yellow and one blue. Which color do you choose? 
 
  Let's choose red. And unfortunately, it's a room full of fire.
